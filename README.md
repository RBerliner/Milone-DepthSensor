# Milone- eTape DepthSensor
SensESP8256 control of Milone depth sensor

The Milone eTape fluid level sensor is a solid state sensor that makes use of a printed circuit board instead of moving mechanical floats. 
The eTape's envelope is compressed by hydrostatic pressure of the fluid in which it is immersed resulting in a change of resistance which corresponds
to the distance from the top of the sensor to the fluid surface.
